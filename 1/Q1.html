    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    	<p>Rip out all the seats in the bus, should be fun.</p>
    
    <center><img border="2" src='../Images/bus.jpg' alt="Bus" align="absmiddle" width="304" height="228" /></center>
    
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
     
        <p>First lets figure out what we are dealing with, we have an average size school bus and hopefully an unlimited amount of standard ping pong balls. <b>The average school bus is about 10ft in height, 8ft in width, and 40ft in length. A ping pong ball is 40mm in diameter.</b><br />
        </p>
    
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
        <p>Now we do a little converting, <b>1 inch is equal to 25.4 millimeters, which makes a ping pong ball 1.3 inches all around. 1.3 inches into a foot is about 9 ping pong balls for each foot of the bus.</b> Lets get some more numbers. <b>9 balls times 8 feet equal to 72 ping pong balls for the width, 9 balls times 10 feet equals 90 balls for the height, and 9 balls times 40 feet is equal to 360 ping pong balls for the length.</b><br />
        </p>
    
    <center><img border="2" src='../Images/pball.jpg' alt="Ping" width="304" height="228" align="absmiddle" /></center>
    
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    
        <p><b>The volume of a rectangular prism is equal to length * width *height, easy enough. We have 72 balls for the width *90 balls for the height * 360 balls for the length which comes out to 2,332,800 ping pong balls that will go into that bus,</b> give or take a few thousand or hundred.<br />
        </p>
        
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
        <p>Now! I don’t know about you, but we aren’t looking at the big picture here, we have a hopefully working bus and over 2 million ping pong balls, if this doesn’t scream fun I don’t know what does. *opens emergency hatch and jumps into the bus full of ping pong balls*</p>
